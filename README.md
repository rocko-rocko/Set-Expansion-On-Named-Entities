Set-Expansion-On-Named-Entities
===============================

Set expansion refers to expanding a given partial set of objects into a more complete set.  In set expansion, the user issues a query consisting of small number of seeds x1,x2,...xk  (assumption we will be given at-least three valid seeds) where each xi is a member of some  target set Si. The answer to query is a listing of other probable elements of Si.
